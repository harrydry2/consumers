      <p class="pBlogBody">Here at Herman-Scheer, one of our top priorities has always been (and always will be) creating a company culture that
        our people love being part of. As a branding agency, a big part of creating that kind of culture is encouraging,
        inspiring, and fostering the creativity and growth of the talented people we bring onto our team.</p>
      <p class="pBlogBody">Of course, accomplishing this goal is an ongoing and constantly evolving process. We are firm believers in a philosophy
        our business strategist, the incomparable Jim Spira, shared with us in our first meeting:</p>
      <p class="pBlogQuote ender">“If you’re not growing, you’re atrophying; There is no status quo.”</p>
      <p class="pBlogBody ender">That’s why we are always developing new strategies and processes that empower our team to meet their full potential.
        Here is a breakdown of ideas we’ve implemented within the last year to assist our employees in their continued intellectual
        and creative growth, which is the key to the success of our team.</p>
      <p class="pBlogBiggerBody ender">1. We Replaced the Annual Review with Monthly 1-on-1 Meetings</p>
      <p class="pBlogBody shortShift">The annual review has been standard practice in companies of all sizes for as long as the existence of business itself.
        Checking in with employees on an individual basis is absolutely necessary because it gives both the employer and
        the employee the opportunity to review performance and hold each other accountable to goals that were established
        at the beginning of the business relationship (or the beginning of the business year.)</p>
      <p class="pBlogBody">This year, we began scheduling individual 15-minute meetings with each of our team members on a monthly basis. Now,
        we are able to keep an open line of communication to discuss HR issues, personal issues, future projects, and goals.
        Beyond these obvious benefits, we have also found that our team members are more comfortable sharing their ideas
        and concerns with us as they arise, which means we can work to address them sooner rather than later.</p>
      <p class="pBlogBody">For a team that thrives on collaboration, this is an invaluable benefit.</p>
      <p class="pBlogBiggerBody ender">2. We Make Fun a Priority</p>
      <p class="pBlogBody shortShift">This next process was actually inspired by a monthly meeting with one of our developers. She mentioned that she missed
        our more frequent team outings and events that allowed us to connect outside of the office. Our team has grown exponentially
        over the course of the last year, and while having fun together both at work and after hours has always been a priority
        for us, spontaneous outings have become a bit trickier to manage.</p>
      <p class="pBlogBody">Figuring out a way to plan more of these activities was already on our minds, but our busy schedules made it difficult
        to find a solution.</p>
      <p class="pBlogBody">Luckily for us, this team member had already come up with one, and she was eager to share it with us. Her idea? The
        Tons of Fun Committee.</p>
