      <p class="pBlogBiggerBody">1. Don't be Vague. Dig Into One Niche Topic</p>
      <p class="pBlogBody shortShift">When writing your personal statement, you need to be aware that the academics who read it will probably be reading
        literally hundreds! So, you need to make it as original as possible, and this is achieved by its content.</p>
      <p class="pBlogBody">If you are applying for Economics, for example, know that the majority of students will reference a set of popular
        books, and make similar comments about them. It is better to delve into one niche topic, and illustrate a degree
        of understanding and appreciation for nuance within the topic. Try and tell the admissions tutor something they don't
        already know</p>
      <p class="pBlogBody">If you can, develop a narrative, such as, ‘I read X and was fascinated by the idea that Y … As a consequence, I read
        Z and realised that my earlier understand was ….’</p>
      <p class="pBlogBiggerBody ender">2. Watch Your Writing Style</p>
      <p class="pBlogBody shortShift">Be careful you don’t fall into the trap of using language that is unnecessarily verbose. It can be a telltale sign
        that a student is trying to compensate for lack of content.</p>
      <p class="pBlogBody">Be wary, too, of making exaggerated claims, and be honest. Did your Bronze D of E really build your resilience? Read
        your draft aloud to family and trusted friends. If they are laughing at what you have said, there is a fair chance
        the academics will be, too! Keep your sentences simple, and your emotions in check.</p>
      <p class="pBlogBiggerBody ender">3. Start Early and Get Feedback</p>
      <p class="pBlogBody shortShift">There is no doubt that writing your personal statement is a stressful and arduous task. It is best to start early,
        in particular, with regard to thinking how you can show your enthusiasm for your chosen course.
      </p>
      <p class="pBlogBody">Expect to do several drafts. It should be your own work and have your voice behind it, but you should listen to feedback
        from all available resources: teachers, friends, parents. You only have 47 Lines. Make sure you make them all count.</p>
      <p class="pBlogBiggerBody ender">4. Go Above and Beyond</p>
      <p class="pBlogBody shortShift">Remember, your personal statement is an opportunity to write about why you want to study the subject you have chosen
        at university. The best way to make such a case is to detail a series of things you have done which illustrate your
        passion for the course.
      </p>
      <p class="pBlogBody">Entering essay competitions and undertaking independent study are one way to show that you are sufficiently interested
        in the subject to go ‘above and beyond’ what you are set at school. Alternatively, you could read books on a particular
        topic and review them in a blog or the school’s magazine, if it has one. or, you could read several on the same topic
        and compare them.</p>
      <p class="pBlogBody">Your personal statement is a chance to ‘bank’ this hard work, and to show the universities that your talk is backed
        up by action. Writing a good personal statement that really stands out starts much earlier than when your teachers
        first tell you to start thinking about it. It’s a long game!</p>
